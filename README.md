# -Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset, provided by Kaggle, contains passenger information such as age, sex, ticket class, and family details. The goal is to build a model that accurately predicts whether a passenger survived or not.
